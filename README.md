MileSplit Time and Event Parser

Full working version in main!



More importantly this project's function is to parse for names and times/distances of athletes and copy them and strucuting them into a table format to then paste into Excel or Google Sheets.


The program asks for 2 things before it can do it, and they are

**School name** _(The beginning of the name or fullName, EX: Rahway HS => Rahway or Rahway HS work!)_

**URL** (Example such as => https://nj.milesplit.com/meets/656383-rahway-rising-stars-invitational-1-2025/results/1137721/formatted/)

Video Example will be added in soon!
